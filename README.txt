Setup instructions:

1. Install Haskell Platform and Euterpea using the instructions on 
   the Euterpea website (www.euterpea.com). Mac and Linux users must
   have a synthesizer installed and running before using GHC/GHCi 
   in order to hear sound!

2. Load the examples in GHCI (:load filename) and follow the usage
   instructions in the file you loaded. The files SimpleBossa.lhs and
   SimpleWalkingBass.lhs are examples from the paper. Hypnotize.lhs is 
   an example of a more complex composition using the same system.
